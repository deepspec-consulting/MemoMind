# MemoMind

1. The basic function of this APP should be a notepad.
2. User can input any short, flashing in mind ideas into this app, by texting or voice.
3. The notes should be able to sort(by modification time) and categorized.
4. There should be a stable, accurate, concise tag for each note. The tags should be generated automatically.
5. The tag should be maintained by a large language model, instead of training a separate ML model.
6. I should be able to use a large language model based UI to interactive with my notes. For example: extract ideas that can be used for my new podcast episode; find my highest purchase last week; etc.
